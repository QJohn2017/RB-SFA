High Harmonic Generation in the Strong Field Approximation via Mathematica

Â© Emilio Pisanty, 2014-2015

RB-SFA is a compact and flexible Mathematica package for calculating High Harmonic Generation emission within the Strong Field Approximation. It combines Mathematica's analytical integration capabilities with its numerical calculation capacities to offer a fast and user-friendly plug-and-play solver for calculating harmonic spectra and other properties. In addition, it can calculate first-order nondipole corrections to the SFA results to evaluate the effect of the driving laser's magnetic field on harmonic spectra.

The name RB-SFA comes from its first application (as Rotating Bicircular High Harmonic Generation in the Strong field Approximation) but the code is general so RB-SFA just stands for itself now. This first application was used to calculate the polarization properties of the harmonics produced by multi-colour circularly polarized fields, as reported in the paper

This software consists of the Mathematica notebook `RB-SFA.nb`, which contains the code and its documentation, a corresponding auto-generated package file `RB-SFA.m`, which provides the package functions to other notebooks, and a PDF printout of the notebook. The notebook also contains a Usage and Examples section which explains how to install and use the code, and documents the calculations used in the original publication.

The author thanks Luke Chipperfield for crucial assistance in writing this program.
